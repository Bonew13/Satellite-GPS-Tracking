The following program first takes as input a base user. This user will be "our" user that we use to check which "other" users is closest to. We will take the name, longitude,latitude, and altitude of "our" user.

The next input will be the amount of "other" users and their data. We will take the name, longitude, latitude, and altitude of all the "other" users.

The inputs can be typed in directly or scanned from a file. 
If scanning from a file, each variable of the users information should be on seperate lines, where the first user in the file is "our" user and the rest are "other users". 

For example:

Bob
123
123
123
John
321
321
321

Where Bob is "our" user and the following 3 lines are his Longitiude, Latitude, and Altitude in that order. John is the first "other" user and the following 3 lines are his Longitiude, Latitude, and Altitude in that order.


The program will output the exact position of all the users inputted. 

It will then output the closest "other" user, as well as the difference in distance between "our" user and the closest "other" user.

In addition, it will also output the current system time in nanoseconds.
